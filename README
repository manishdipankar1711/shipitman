Problem Description
Create a repository on GitHub and write a program in any programming language that will do the following:
Input : User can input a link to any public GitHub repository

Output :
Your UI should display a table with the following information -
- Total number of open issues
- Number of open issues that were opened in the last 24 hours
- Number of open issues that were opened more than 24 hours ago but less than 7 days ago
- Number of open issues that were opened more than 7 days ago
Deploy your application to Heroku or similar platform.
Please be careful about the following -
- The code should be well commented and easy to understand.
- Include a readme file explaining your solution and a URL where the application is live
- In the readme file, please also explain how you could improve your solution given more time


=================================================================================================

The github link can be found at : https://github.com/manishdipankar1711/shipitman


Errors in URL entered are handled, and different kinds of errors give different messages for easier debugging.

Comparing the 'created_at' timestamp for an issue with now minus 24 hours
now minus 7 days to get the data required.

The App takes care of complete list of open issues, not just first 100.

To run the app : go to folder shippable.
nohup python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 &
and open this link in browser : http://localhost:3000/index.html


Scope of improvement :
1. We have myriad of data from the API,
    the UI can include as many thing as anybody could ever want.
2. Since the requirement was very small, scope is limited.
    But if taken on a large scale, literally the complete git client UI can be created from these API's.
